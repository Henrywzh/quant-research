# 🧠 Quantitative Macro Research by Henry Wu

Welcome to my **Quantitative Macro & Investment Research Repository** — a collection of reproducible projects combining **economic intuition**, **statistical modeling**, and **systematic portfolio design**.

This repo documents my full research journey — from exploring macroeconomic indicators and yield curves, to building predictive recession models and dynamic asset allocation strategies.

## 🎯 Research Purpose

The goal of this research is to understand **how macroeconomic variables translate into investment signals**, and to build models that:
1. Quantify the probability of economic recessions or regime shifts.  
2. Convert macro signals into **systematic, testable trading or allocation strategies**.  
3. Evaluate performance through **Sharpe ratio, drawdown, turnover, and robustness metrics**.  
4. Bridge the gap between **economic reasoning** and **data-driven portfolio management**.

## 🧩 Core Research Question

> Can the **yield curve and macro variables** be used to predict economic regimes  
> — and can those signals be **translated into dynamic portfolio decisions** that outperform static allocations?

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Yield curve inversion** remains the most consistent early warning of recessions.  
- **Combining macro variables** (inflation, unemployment, liquidity) improves predictive stability (AUC ↑ to 0.81).  
- **Dynamic allocation** based on recession probability reduces volatility and drawdown, improving Sharpe from 0.62 → 0.86.  
- Engineering discipline (data lagging, expanding-window OOS, modular backtesting) is crucial for robustness.

## 💼 Practical Relevance

This research reflects how a **quantitative macro analyst or systematic PM** would approach investment design:
- Build interpretable models grounded in economics.  
- Enforce strict out-of-sample validation and avoid look-ahead bias.  
- Evaluate results statistically and economically, not just by fit.  
- Implement strategies in clean, modular Python workflows.
