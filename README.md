# 📈 quant-research

A personal quantitative research repository for systematic investing across multiple asset classes. This repo consolidates experiments and notes on portfolio construction, alpha research, and robust evaluation workflows, with a focus on practical, reproducible research.

---

## 🎯 Scope

This project covers:

- 🌍 **Multi-asset research:** equities, rates, FX, commodities, and major ETFs/indices  
- ⏱️ **Market timing & overlays:** regime-aware exposure management, volatility targeting, risk controls  
- ⚖️ **Relative value / long–short:** cross-sectional signals, ranking frameworks, spread trades, hedged portfolios  
- 🧭 **Macro regime research:** slow-moving macro proxies used as context for positioning and risk management  
- 🤖 **ML in quant finance:** feature engineering, model selection, validation discipline, and backtest integration  

---

## ✨ Repository Highlights

- 🧪 **Research notebooks / experiments:** iterative exploration of signals, regimes, and portfolio rules  
- 🧰 **Backtesting & evaluation:** performance attribution, drawdowns, turnover, and robustness checks  
- 📝 **Reusable outputs and notes:** distilled findings and write-ups for future reference  

---

## 📚 Key Findings and Write-ups

Useful research notes, summaries, and findings are stored in the **`pdf/`** directory.  
If you want the quickest overview of what has been tested and what worked/didn’t, start there.

## 🔁 Typical Research Workflow

1. 💡 Define hypothesis (signal, regime overlay, or relative-value construct)  
2. 🧹 Validate data quality and tradability assumptions  
3. 🧱 Implement baseline strategy + sensible benchmark  
4. 📊 Evaluate (returns, risk, drawdowns, turnover, stability)  
5. 🧯 Run robustness checks (subperiods, parameter sensitivity, alternative universes)  
6. 🗂️ Document conclusions and next steps in `pdf/`  

---

## 🧭 Conventions

- 🚫 Focus on **no-lookahead** logic and realistic rebalancing assumptions  
- 🧩 Prefer **simple baselines** before introducing complexity  
- 📌 Separate research exploration from conclusions (write-ups live in `pdf/`)
